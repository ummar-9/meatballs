INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with non-stick spray. 
Combine the meat, egg, breadcrumbs, cheese, salt, garlic, onion, black pepper and parsley in a bowl. Stir just until combined, do not over mix. Add a Tablespoon or two of water as needed to keep a wet mixture. 
Use a medium cookie scoop or spoon to scoop the meat. Then form into 1 1/2"  balls and place on the pan. 
Bake uncovered for 17-20 minutes, or until no longer pink in the middle. Turn halfway through, so the bottoms don't brown. 
Simmer meatballs with marinara sauce for 10 minutes and serve over noodles if desired
